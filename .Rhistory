abstract <- "Most alpine floodplains are heavily modified and have lost their natural habitat dynamics and biodi-
versity. However, little is known about the consequences for floodplain forests. To study this topic, the
Bavarian River Ammer was selected. An analysis of the effects of river regulation was possible within
the ‘Schnalzaue’ where 55 years ago a weir and a dam had been built separating an active and inactive
section of the floodplain. A comparison between both sections helps assessing the effect of the dam on
the  alluvial  grey-alder  forests  (Alnetum  incanae),  as  basis  for  future  restoration.  We  expected  lower
disturbance, lower moisture and higher nutrient supply in the inactive floodplain and thus, a transition
to a maple-ash forest (Adoxo-Aceretum). Therefore, we analysed species composition, functional plant
traits of the leaf-height-seed scheme (leaf dry matter content, plant height, seed mass) and Ellenberg
indicators (indicator values for moisture and nutrients, indicator species for flooding and for periodical
wet  conditions).  The  ordination  results  indicated  different  species  compositions  in  both  floodplain
sections, while this was poorly reflected by the results of a syntaxonomic analysis. The latter suggested
presence of a rarely flooded Asarum-subassociation of grey-alder forest in both floodplain sections. In
the sections, similar site conditions prevailed regarding moisture and nutrient supply, while plant height
indicated slightly more disturbance in the active floodplain. Overall, the results reveal low disturbance
in both sections, even though the active one is connected with the river. A reason for this finding could
be increased erosion of River Ammer downstream the weir with respective lower water levels. Accord-
ingly, restoration should improve river dynamics in the entire floodplain to allow more frequent dis-
turbance as a measure to maintain the grey-alder forest in the long term."
